# Memory_Card_Game
A Memory Card Game, also known as a Matching Game, is a simple and fun game designed to test and improve memory skills. The game consists of a set of cards placed face down, each card having a pair. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, aiming to find matching pairs. If the cards match, the player keeps the pair and gets another turn; if not, the cards are flipped back face down, and the next player takes their turn. The game ends when all pairs are matched, and the player with the most pairs wins.

It's a great exercise for concentration and visual memory!
